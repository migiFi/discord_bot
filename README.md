This is a `Discord bot` project for my guild, Some goals for it so far is to be able to manage users (welcome, kick/ban, etc.), be able to play music from voice-channel. If you want to use this project be aware that YouTube is now tracking on this and did not like the amount of request I did while testing (use VPN if possible) :D.
