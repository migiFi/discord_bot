# TurtleBot

This is a `Discord bot` project for my guild, Some goals for it so far is to be able to manage users (welcome, kick/ban, etc.), be able to play music from voice-channels(roughly done), and updates and player count for each of the game-channels. 

I will update this readme file as I go.
